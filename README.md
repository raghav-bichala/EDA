About Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. EDA is typically one of the first steps in the data analysis process, helping to uncover patterns, anomalies, relationships, and other insights that may inform subsequent analysis.

Contents
notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks documenting different EDA projects.
scripts/: Contains scripts for data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis.
datasets/: Placeholder for datasets used in the analysis. (Note: If datasets are too large to be stored in the repository, provide instructions on how to obtain them.)
resources/: Supplementary materials, such as documentation, papers, or tutorials related to EDA techniques.
